# Scoring-synchronization-between-motion-and-music
This repository contains the implementation of the methods described in the paper titled "Scoring Synchronization Between Music and Motion: Local vs Global Approaches," presented at EUSIPCO 2024. The code provided here enables the reproduction of the testing results reported in the paper.


# Introduction 
In the field of music and motion synchronization, understanding the alignment between musical events and corresponding motion cues is crucial. This repository provides a set of methods and algorithms aimed at scoring the synchronization between music and motion, exploring both local and global approaches.

# Usage 

The methods presented here were tested on synthetic data 
    
To run the code and test the different metrics : 
    
1. python main_test.py
