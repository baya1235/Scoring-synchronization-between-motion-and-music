# Scoring-synchronization-between-motion-and-music
This repository is the implementation of the following paper " Scoring synchronization between music and motion: local Vs global approaches" EUSIPCO 2024. Our code can reproduce the testing results reported in the paper.  

Introduction : 

In the field of music and motion synchronization, understanding the alignment between musical events and corresponding motion cues is crucial. This repository provides a set of methods and algorithms aimed at scoring the synchronization between music and motion, exploring both local and global approaches.

Usage : 

The methods presented here were tested on synthetic data 
    
To run the code and test the different metrics : 
    
1. python main_test.py
