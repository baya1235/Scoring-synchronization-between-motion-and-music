# Scoring-synchronization-between-motion-and-music
Overview:
This repository contains code and resources for scoring the relationship between motion and music. The methods presented here were rigorously tested on synthetic data to assess their efficacy and select the most relevant ones. Additionally, a system for evaluating real synchronization performance between music and movement is introduced.

Features:
Data Analysis: Techniques such as Gaussian, relative phase, and dynamic time warping (DTW) are employed for analyzing the relationship between motion and music.
Evaluation System: A comprehensive system is provided for evaluating synchronization performance between music and movement. It takes a motion video clip as input, extracts motion beats by analyzing participant movementâ€™s speed and direction changes, and subsequently evaluates synchronization performance by comparing motion beats with music beats.

#Usage:
Researchers and practitioners in the field of music and motion synchronization can benefit from this repository. The provided code and resources offer valuable insights and tools for analyzing and evaluating the intricate relationship between motion and music.

Contents:
Codebase: Contains implementations of various scoring techniques and the evaluation system in Python.
Datasets: Synthetic and real-world datasets used for testing and evaluation purposes.
Documentation: Detailed documentation and usage guides to help users effectively utilize the provided resources.
Contribution:
Contributions from the research community are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests for bug fixes, enhancements, or additional scoring techniques.
